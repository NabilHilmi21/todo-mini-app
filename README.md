The code is far from efficient, and there are plenty of things that need improvement or fixing.

Things to Improve or Fix:
1. Optimize the Code – Improve efficiency and readability.

3. Daily Reset – Automatically reset the task counter at the start of a new day.
4. Task History – Keep a record of completed tasks.
5. Okay, what’s going on? The fonts aren’t loading...
